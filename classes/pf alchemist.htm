			<div id="classability1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body"><p>PF Alchemists are not only masters of creating mundane alchemical substances such as alchemist’s fire and smokesticks, but also of fashioning magical potion<s>-like extracts in which they can store spell effects. In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by drinking the extract</s>. When an alchemist creates an <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark> or bomb, he infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical power—this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the effects to the creator. <s>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the Craft (alchemy) check.</s> <mark>Expertise when crafting using Alchemist's Supplies</mark> In addition, an alchemist can use <s>Craft (alchemy)</s><mark>Alchemist's Supplies</mark> to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.</p>
			<p>An alchemist can create three special types of magical items—<s>extracts</s><mark>potions</mark>, bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his physical abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections below.</p>
			<p><s>Extracts</s><mark>Potions</mark> are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by effects like dispel magic using the pf alchemist’s level as the caster level. Unlike potions, though, extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a potion normally could not.</p>
			<p>An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. <s>His base daily allotment of extracts is given on Table: Alchemist.</s> In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day. When an alchemist mixes a<s>n extract</s><mark>potion</mark>, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark> with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark> immediately becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist’s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping—an alchemist cannot normally pass out his <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>s for allies to use (but see the “infusion” discovery below). An <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>, once created, remains potent for 1 day before becoming inert, so an alchemist must re-prepare his <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>s every day. Mixing an <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark> takes 1 minute of work—most alchemists prepare many <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>s at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but it’s not uncommon for an alchemist to keep some (or even all) of his daily <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark> slots open so that he can prepare <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>s in the field as needed.</p>
			<p><s>Although the alchemist doesn’t actually cast spells, he does have</s><mark>The pf alchemist has</mark> a formulae list that determines what <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>s he can create. <s>An alchemist can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formulae list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses Use Magic Device to do so). An extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a potion—the effects of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist.</s> The alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect based on caster level. Creating <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>s consumes raw materials, but the cost of these materials is insignificant—comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If <s>a spell normally</s><mark>the formulae</mark> has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular <s>extract</s><mark>potion</mark>. <s>Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement). An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the extract’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.</s></p>
			<div style="text-align:center;"><mark>Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</mark></div> 
			<p>An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs and time requirements. An alchemist can study a wizard’s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them.</p></div>

			<div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#classability2">Bomb</a></h4></div>
			<div id="classability2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body"><p>In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst—the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster’s component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day—once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.</p>
			<p>Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb’s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up. An alchemist’s bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p></div>

			<div class="panel-body"><p><s>At 1st level, alchemists receive Brew Potion as a bonus feat.</s> An alchemist can brew potions of any formulae he knows (up to 3rd level), using his alchemist level as his caster level. <s>The spell must be one that can be made into a potion.

			<div id="classability4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body"><p>At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time—if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist’s possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again.</p>
			<p>When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score—either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It’s a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 <s>natural armor bonus</s><mark>AC</mark> and a +4 <s>alchemical bonus </s>to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his Charisma.</p>
			<p>A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a <s>Fortitude</s><mark>Con</mark> save (<s>DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier</s>) or become <s>nauseated</s><mark>poisoned</mark> for 1 hour—a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist’s mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.</p>

			<tr><th>Discovery</th><th>Prerequisites</th><th>Benefits</th></tr>
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 1</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Elemental Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>When the pf alchemist creates a bomb, they can choose to have it do one of the following damage types: acid, cold, lightning, or thunder instead of fire damage.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Chameleon</td><td>—</td><td>Your skin changes colors, granting you advantage on Stealth checks</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Cognatogen</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist gains the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. If the cognatogen enhances his Intelligence, it applies a penalty to his Strength. If it enhances his Wisdom, it applies a penalty to his Dexterity. If it enhances his Charisma, it applies a penalty to his Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime the alchemist would prepare a mutagen, he may instead prepare a cognatogen. All limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same substance—an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a time, a cognatogen that is not in an alchemist’s possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of the cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Concentrate Poison</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist can combine two doses of the same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison’s frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Darkness Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it suppress light sources on the target. This extinguishes non-magical light sources carried by the target and dispels magical light sources for 1 round/level as deeper darkness.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Ectoplasmic Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist can infuse her bombs with a special unction that damages incorporeal creatures and reveals the presence of undead creatures hiding in the area. Incorporeal creatures struck by an ectoplasmic bomb take full damage from the bomb. In addition, squares in the affected area of the bomb begin to faintly glow in the spaces where undead creatures have traveled in the last minute, including undead benefiting from invisibility or other forms of obscurity (such as ethereal jaunt), effectively creating a glowing trail. Any undead creatures in the affected area at the time of the explosion likewise glow faintly. This glowing effect lasts for 1 minute, and is otherwise identical to faerie fire.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Elemental Mutagen</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist chooses an element (air, earth, fire, or water). Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains resistance 5 to the associated energy type and a +2 competence bonus on an associated skill check. This resistance increases by 5 and the competence bonus by 2 for each of the following discoveries the alchemist possesses: grand mutagen, greater mutagen, and true mutagen. The elements and their associated energies and skills are air (electricity, Fly), earth (acid, Climb), fire (fire, Acrobatics), and water (cold, Swim).<br>An alchemist can select this discovery up to four times, but must choose a different element each time. An alchemist can gain the benefits of only one elemental mutagen at a time, selected when he imbibes the mutagen.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Enhance Potion</td><td>—</td><td>A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Explosive Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist’s bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet (see Throw Splash Weapon). Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Extend Potion</td><td>—</td><td>A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration. This does not apply to extracts.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Feral Mutagen</td><td>—</td><td>Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist’s full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate skill checks.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Fire Brand</td><td>Goblin</td><td>An alchemist with this discovery can expend one daily bomb use to apply the bomb reagents to his weapon as a swift action. A weapon treated this way deals fire damage as if it had the flaming weapon special ability.<br>At 10th level, the weapon is treated as if it had the flaming burst weapon special ability. The bomb reagents continue burning for 1 minute or until extinguished by dousing the weapon in water.<br>An alchemist can use this ability with natural weapons, but he takes 1d6 points of fire damage per round for each natural weapon treated.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Flesh-Eating Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>Your bomb deals damage one die step higher than normal (regular bombs deal d8s, concussive bombs deal 1d6, and so on), but they have no effect on inorganic matter. In addition, a creature with at least a +1 armor bonus to AC is less likely to be harmed; such creatures in the bomb’s splash radius take no damage on a successful Reflex save, and the target of a direct hit can attempt a Reflex save against the bomb’s save DC to take only half damage.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Glassfoot Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>You can cover the ground in jagged crystals in addition to its normal effects. These crystals act like caltrops, evaporating into a smelly but harmless gas in 2d6 rounds.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Defoliant Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>These poisonous bombs clear away foliage, dealing extra damage to plant creatures. When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal extra damage against plant creatures but less damage against other creatures. Against creatures with the plant type, a defoliant bomb deals 1d8 points of damage, plus 1d8 points of damage for every odd-numbered level the alchemist possesses, instead of 1d6. Against all other creatures, the defoliant bomb only deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. This is a poison effect. A defoliant bomb kills all normal vegetation in the target’s square and its splash area; any plant-based difficult terrain in the affected area becomes normal terrain.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Grounding Goo</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist’s bomb applies a sticky residue after any damage from the bomb is resolved. If a creature damaged by the bomb has a non-magical fly speed, its flight is severely impaired, and it takes a penalty equal to the alchemist’s level on Fly checks for 1 minute.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Healing Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it heal damage instead of dealing it. Creating a healing bomb requires the alchemist to expend an infused extract or potion containing a cure spell. A creature that takes a direct hit from a healing bomb is healed as if she had imbibed the infusion or potion used to create the bomb. Creatures in the splash radius are healed for the minimum amount of damage the cure spell is capable of healing. A healing bomb damages undead instead of healing them.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Infuse Mutagen</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates a mutagen he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens—only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Infusion</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist’s daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Inspired Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>An alchemist with this discovery and a pool of inspiration (by way of a class feature, a feat, or the inspiring cognatogen discovery) can expend two uses of inspiration to increase the bomb’s damage by 1d6. The type of damage the bomb deals does not change. Unlike other a discoveries that affect bombs, this one can be applied to a bomb with another bomb discovery, though it cannot be applied to the same bomb more than once.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Pheromones </td><td>—</td><td>You count as trained in on Persuasion and Intimidation.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Neutralizing Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving throw, this bomb doesn’t allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. This discovery doesn’t stack with any other that modifies bombs.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Precise Bombs</td><td>—</td><td>Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Tanglefoot Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save against the bomb’s DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a tanglefoot bag. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Tentacle</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist gains a prehensile, arm-length tentacle on his body. The tentacle is fully under his control and cannot be concealed except with magic or bulky clothing. The tentacle does not give the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, though he can use it to make a tentacle attack (1d4 damage for a Medium alchemist, 1d3 damage for a Small one) with the grab ability. The tentacle can manipulate or hold items as well as the alchemist’s original arms can (for example, allowing the alchemist to use one hand to wield a weapon, the tentacle to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb). Unlike an arm, the tentacle has no magic item slots.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Thorny Bomb (Su)</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal piercing damage. Thorny bombs count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Underwater Demolition</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist gains the ability to throw bombs underwater (normally, thrown weapons cannot be used underwater), including throwing from the air into the water. If the bomb travels through water, the range increment is reduced to 5 feet.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Sandstone Solution</td><td>—</td><td>As a full-round action, the alchemist can convert any potion or extract into a solution that, when thrown or applied, solidifies sand or dirt to the hardness of stone for 1 hour, affecting an area with a radius of 10 feet × the level of the potion or extract. If this solution is thrown at or applied to stone, it instead causes a 5-foot cube of stone to become crumbly and soft for 1 minute, reducing its hardness by double the level of the potion or extract.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Scrap Bomb</td><td>Goblin</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of shrapnel that deal piercing damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from a scrap bomb takes 1 point of bleed damage per die of bomb damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Shock Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Smoke Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions as fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb’s splash radius for 1 round per level.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Spontaneous Healing</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist gains the ability to heal from wounds rapidly. As a free action once per round, he can heal 5 hit points as if he had the fast healing ability. He can heal 5 hit points per day in this manner for every 2 alchemist levels he possesses. If the alchemist falls unconscious because of hit point damage and he still has healing available from this ability, the ability activates automatically each round until he is conscious again or the ability is depleted for the day.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Strafe Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist can throw bombs that splash in a 40-foot line rather than affecting a radius. The line starts at the alchemist and extends away from him in the direction he chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the line to be the target of the bomb and makes his attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the line take splash damage.<br>Special: If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive strafe bomb, the line of splash damage is 80 feet long instead of 40 feet.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Volumizer (Su)</td><td>—</td><td>The alchemist can use an extract slot of any level to create a reactive tablet that purifies water and doubles its volume. This works like purify food and drink for a maximum volume of water equal to 1 gallon for each level the alchemist has × the level of the extract slot the alchemist used to create the tablet. Additionally, if the alchemist has a receptacle of sufficient volume to gather the water, the tablet doubles the volume of pure water. The water volume increases over the course of 1 minute, but the effect stops before it can create significant water pressure on a container that’s not large enough to hold the entire volume. An unused tablet remains usable until the next time the alchemist recovers extract slots.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 3</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Immolation Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 3</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target’s body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb’s effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist’s turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb’s direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 4</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Explosive Missile</td><td>Alchemist 4</td><td>The alchemist’s bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet (see Throw Splash Weapon). Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Ranged Baptism</td><td>Alchemist 4</td><td>When the alchemist uses holy water as a splash weapon, any squares subject to its effects (including creatures affected by splash damage) or that contain creatures subject to its effects are also affected as if by consecrate, for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. Undead struck by holy water remain affected by the consecrate effect even if they leave the affected area.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Remedy Extract</td><td>Alchemist 4</td><td>When the alchemist creates an extract, he can add one non-magical alchemical remedy (such as an antitoxin) to it. When the extract is consumed, both the formula and the alchemical remedy take effect. The extract has a level 1 higher than normal. This discovery cannot be combined with other methods of combining multiple consumed items or extracts into one.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 6</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Bottled Ooze</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>The alchemist has learned how to preserve a sample of oozes in a sealed bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he actually throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the ooze, which reconstitutes and attacks the closest creature. The ooze is not under the alchemist’s control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The ooze remains for 1 round per caster level, and decays into powder when the duration expires. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a bottled ooze requires an extract with a level equal to the ooze’s CR (so a CR 4 gray ooze requires a 4th-level extract).</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Breath Weapon Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the alchemist’s bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Concussive Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Dispelling Bomb</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted dispel magic spell, using the alchemist’s level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Explosive Calligraphy</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>The alchemist can create especially volatile pigments that detonate when agitated. This requires expending one daily use of his bombs, but otherwise functions as explosive runes except that it deals damage as one of the alchemist’s bombs. The alchemist can expend an additional daily use of his bombs to apply one discovery that applies to his bombs, such as acid bomb or dispelling bomb, to the runes created with this discovery.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Grease Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a grease slick upon detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the bomb’s splash radius in grease (as the grease spell) for 1 round per level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling after a failed Acrobatics check is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. A grease bomb can’t affect items or armor.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Healing Touch</td><td>Alchemist 6, spontaneous healing</td><td>The alchemist gains the ability to heal other creatures. As a standard action, he may touch a creature and apply 1 round’s effect of his spontaneous healing discovery to that creature; this counts toward his spontaneous healing limit for the day. The alchemist’s daily limit for hit points healed by spontaneous healing increases to 5 × his alchemist level. This ability only functions if the target is the same type of creature (humanoid, undead, and so on) as the alchemist.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Poison Conversion</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an <s>alchemy lab</s><mark>alchemist's kit</mark>.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Promethean Disciple</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>You know how to craft constructs by way of alchemical research rather than arcane magic. <s>You gain Craft Construct as a bonus feat without needing to meet its requirements and you substitute the number of ranks in Craft (alchemy) you have for your total caster level and must use Craft (alchemy) to create the construct.</s><mark>You can make constructs with a total combined CR equal to half your pf alchemist level.</mark></td></tr>
			<tr><td>Psychoactive Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>Psychoactive bombs are mixed with neurotoxic extracts that heighten certain sensations.<br>A creature struck by a psychoactive bomb <s>takes a –1 penalty</s><mark>have disadvantage</mark> on saving throws against charm, emotion, fear, pain effects, and Intimidate checks. This effect lasts for 1 hour per alchemist level. These penalties do not stack, and a creature can only be affected by a single psychoactive bomb at a time. A psychoactive bomb deals 1d6 fewer hit points of damage than normal.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Rocket Bomb</td><td>Goblin, alchemist 6th</td><td>Alchemists with this discovery can prepare special rockets to deliver their bombs. Rocket bombs travel farther and explode bigger than normal bombs, but cannot target individual creatures. Rocket bombs explode in a 20-foot radius, and all creatures in that area take the alchemist’s normal splash damage. The range increment on a rocket bomb is 50 feet. Rocket bombs cannot be used with the precise bomb or fast bomb discoveries.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Sticky Poison</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky—when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Syringe Stirge</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>As a full-round action, you can expend two daily uses of bombs to create a syringe stirge, a tiny construct primed with a bomb (if you have multiple types of bombs, you must select which type the syringe stirge carries when created). Undirected, they take no actions except to flock around you in your square and follow you as best they can. They can be attacked normally, but gain cover while occupying your square. As a swift action, you can order one of your syringe stirges to attack an enemy it can see. Once ordered to attack that enemy, the syringe stirge will continue to attack every round, attempting to attach and deliver its payload<br>A syringe stirge has all of the statistics of a stirge but lacks the blood drain ability.<br>If it ends its turn attached to an opponent, it injects your bomb into the opponent’s bloodstream, dealing damage as a direct hit plus the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier (as the Throw Anything feat—this injection is a direct attack and doesn’t deal splash damage. A syringe stirge dies immediately after injecting its bomb. A syringe stirge lasts for 1 minute per alchemist level or until destroyed; if it has not attached to an enemy before the end of its life span, it and its bomb payload fall inert.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Void Bomb*</td><td>Drow, alchemist 6</td><td>By combining the spores from strange fungi with slivers from extradimensional voids, some drow alchemists create bombs that cause bursts of gravity capable of crushing those inside.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Wings</td><td>Alchemist 6</td><td>The alchemist gains bat-like, bird-like, or insect-like functional wings, allowing him to fly as the fly spell for a number of minutes per day equal to his caster level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 8</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Blinding Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose for it to detonate very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute. This is a light effect.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Combine Extracts</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Confusion Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>The alchemist’s bombs twist the target’s perception of friend and foe. A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb and is under the effect of a confusion spell for 1 round per caster level of the alchemist. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead).</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Deadly Excretions</td><td>Alchemist 8, grung</td><td>When using his toxic skin ability, the alchemist can choose to excrete a Constitution poison instead<s> of a Dexterity poison</s>. This poison works the same as the normal grung toxic skin poison except that a failed save deals 1 point of Constitution damage.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Delayed Bomb</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb’s detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb’s contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage (see Throw Splash Weapon) to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel magic can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier).</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Demolition Charge*</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal damage to an object as if by a sunder combat maneuver. If the item is worn or held by an opponent, the item is considered the direct target, and the wearer/holder takes splash damage from the blast. If the object is unattended, a demolition charge deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on a direct hit. This bonus doesn’t affect the bomb’s splash damage.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Fast Bombs</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw <mark>an</mark> additional bomb as <s>a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant them additional attacks</s><mark>part of their attack action</mark>.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Force Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Holy/Unholy Bombs*</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal radiant or necrotic damage.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Phantom Limb</td><td>Alchemist 8</td><td>The alchemist can manifest a ghostly, incorporeal arm that juts out from his torso. This phantom limb does not grant the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, and it cannot hold or grab anything (including incorporeal objects). The alchemist may use his phantom limb to make a touch attack against a foe as a standard action, scraping away at the very fibers of the victim’s soul. This attack deals 1d4 points of damage per alchemist level (<s>Fortitude</s><mark>Constitution</mark> half). <s>Creatures that are immune to incorporeal attacks are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction except DR/epic.</s> The alchemist may suppress or activate this ability as a free action, and can use his phantom limb for a number of rounds per day equal to <s>3 + his Intelligence modifier</s><mark>Proficiency Bonus</mark> (these rounds need not be consecutive).</td></tr>
			
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 10</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Malignant Poison</td><td>Alchemist 10</td><td>As a full-round action, the alchemist can increase the save DC of any poison by 4 and increase its duration by 2 frequency increments (for example, large scorpion venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6 and drow poison lasts 4 minutes instead of 2). Additionally, malignant poisons take effect immediately and do not have an onset time. This alchemical change lasts until the poison’s extended duration ends or for a number of minutes equal to the alchemist’s level, whichever comes first. After that, the poison reverts back to its original state.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Sticky Bomb</td><td>Alchemist 10</td><td>The effects of the alchemist’s bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Sunlight Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 10<s>, blinding bomb</s></td><td>The alchemist can throw bombs that explode with a searing radiance equivalent to that of sunlight and that act as blinding bombs. Undead, fungi, molds, oozes, slimes, and creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take +2 damage per die from the bomb. Undead that are harmed by sunlight and that fail their saves against the bomb are staggered for 1 round.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 12</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Collective Memory</td><td><s>Cognatogen discovery</s></td><td><s>While under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist adds half his class level on all Knowledge skill checks and may attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.

			<tr><td>Cursed Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 12</td><td>When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deliver a debilitating curse. A creature that takes a direct hit from a cursed bomb must succeed at a Will save or be affected by bestow curse.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Dilution</td><td>Alchemist 12</td><td>Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion’s market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again. This discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Greater Mutagen</td><td>Alchemist 12</td><td>The alchemist’s mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty on both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Madness Bomb</td><td>Alchemist 12</td><td>The alchemist’s bombs do more than sear flesh—they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Nauseating Flesh</td><td>Alchemist 12</td><td>The alchemist’s body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a <s>Fortitude</s><mark>Constitution</mark> saving throw or be <s>nauseated</s><mark>poisoned</mark> for 1d4 rounds. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Poison Bomb*</td><td>Alchemist 12, smoke bomb</td><td>The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist’s bomb duplicates the effects of cloudkill instead of fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb’s splash radius for 1 round per level.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Splitting Mutagen</td><td>Alchemist 12</td><td>Once per day while under the effects of your mutagen, you can split into two identical copies of yourself as an immediate action after being damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon.<br>Each copy has an ooze-like complexion, most often manifesting as a slimy sheen to his skin. You split your current hit points evenly between the copies. The copies use the same statistics, share the same resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate item disappears from the other copy as well. The two copies act independently and each one has a full set of actions.<br>At the end of your next turn, select one of the copies, which loses its ooze-like complexion as it becomes the alchemist; the other copy dissolves into a fine mist and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and you gain 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed simultaneously (such as from a fireball), both copies collapse into formless goo and you can only be restored to life via resurrection or similarly powerful magic.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><th colspan="3">Level 16</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Elixir of Life</td><td>Alchemist 16</td><td>Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell true resurrection. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a resurrection spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end.</td></tr>

			<tr><td>Glimmering Infusion</td><td>Infusion discovery</td><td>The alchemist can expend any prepared extract to produce a cube of glowing motes that act as per glitterdust. The area must be adjacent to the alchemist and covers one 5-foot square per level of extract sacrificed, and the effect’s save DC is calculated using the level of the sacrificed extract.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Grand Cognatogen</td><td>Alchemist 16, greater cognatogen</td><td>The alchemist’s mutagen now grants a +6 <s>natural armor bonus</s><mark>AC</mark>, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score.

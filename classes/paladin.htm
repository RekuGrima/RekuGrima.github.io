You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).

			<br>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

			<div class="panel-body"><p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.</p>
			<p>Preparing and Casting Spells<br>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<p>Spellcasting Ability<br>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<div style="text-align:center;">Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
				<br>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</div>
			<p>Spellcasting Focus<br>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p></div>

The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p></div>

			<p>Channel Divinity<br>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.<br>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

    <div id="arch1" class="tab-pane fade"><!-- Oath of Devotion -->
		<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels — the perfect servants of good — as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tenets of Devotion<dl>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</dl></li>
			<dl>Honesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</dl>
			<dl>Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</dl>
			<dl>Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</dl>
			<dl>Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</dl>
			<dl>Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</dl></ul>

		<p>Channel Divinity<br>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
		<ul><dl>Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.<br>You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</dl>
		<dl>Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
		<br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</dl></ul>
		<p>Aura of Devotion<br>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.<br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
		<p>Purity of Spirit<br>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.</p>
		<p>Holy Nimbus<br>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.<br>Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.<br>In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.<br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <div id="arch2" class="tab-pane fade"><!-- Oath of the Ancients -->
      <p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things — leaves, antlers, or flowers — to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p>
	  <ul><li>Tenets of the Ancients<br>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</li>
	  <dl>Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</dl>
	  <dl>Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</dl>
	  <dl>Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.</dl>
	  <dl>Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</dl></ul>

	  <p>Channel Divinity<br>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
	  <p>Nature’s Wrath.<br>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</p>
	  <p>Turn the Faithless.<br>You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
	  <br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
	  <br>If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>
	  <p>Aura of Warding<br>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.<br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
	  <p>Undying Sentinel<br>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
	  <br>Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.</p>
	  <p>Elder Champion<br>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.<br>Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:<ul>
		<dl>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</dl>
		<dl>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</dl>
		<dl>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.</dl>
		<dl>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</dl></ul></p>

    <div id="arch3" class="tab-pane fade"><!-- Oath of Vengeance -->
      <p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside — at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins — sometimes called avengers or dark knights — their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</p>
	  <p>Tenets of Vengeance<br>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</p>
	  <ul>
		<dl>Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.</dl>

	<p>Channel Divinity<br>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
	<p>Abjure Enemy.<br>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br>On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.	<br>On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
	<p>Vow of Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p>
	<p>Relentless Avenger<br>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
	<p>Soul of Vengeance<br>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p>
	<p>Avenging Angel<br>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:</p>
	<ul>
	  <dl>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</dl>
	  <dl>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.</dl>
	  <dl>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</dl></ul>

    <div id="arch4" class="tab-pane fade"><!-- Oathbreaker -->
	<p>An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin’s heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.<br>A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to become an Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the features specific to his or her Sacred Oath with Oathbreaker features.</p>
	<p>Oathbreaker Spells<br>An Oathbreaker paladin loses previously gained oath spells and instead gains the following Oathbreaker spells at the paladin levels listed.
	  <table class="cls" style="width:33%; float: right;">
		<tr><th colspan="2">Oathbreaker Spells</th></tr>
		<tr><th>Paladin Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>
		<tr><td>3rd</td><td>hellish rebuke, inflict wounds</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5th</td><td>crown of madness, darkness</td></tr>

		<tr><td>17th</td><td>contagion, dominate person</td></tr></table>
	<p>Channel Divinity<br>An Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
	<p>Control Undead. As an action, the paladin targets one undead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him or her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin’s commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the paladin’s level is immune to this effect.</p>
	<p>Dreadful Aspect. As an action, the paladin channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of the paladin’s choice within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.</p>
	<p>Aura of Hate<br>Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin’s Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time.<br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
	<p>Supernatural Resistance<br>At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>
	<p>Dread Lord<br>At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.<br>While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + the paladin’s Charisma modifier.<br>After activating the aura, the paladin can’t do so again until he or she finishes a long rest.</p>
	<p>OATHBREAKER ATONEMENT<br>If you allow a player to choose the Oathbreaker option, you can later allow the paladin to atone and become a true paladin once more.<br>The paladin who wishes to atone must first shed his or her evil alignment and demonstrate this alignment change through words and deeds. Having done so, the paladin loses all Oathbreaker features and must choose a deity and a sacred oath. (With your permission, the player can select a different deity or sacred oath than the character had previously.) However, the paladin doesn’t gain the class features specific to that sacred oath until he or she completes some kind of dangerous quest or trial, as determined by the DM.</p>A paladin who breaks his or her sacred oath a second time can become an oathbreaker once more, but can’t atone.</p>

	<div id="arch5" class="tab-pane fade"><!-- Oath of the Crown -->
		<p>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order’s ranks.</p>
		<p>Tenets of the Crown<br>The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</p>
			<ul>
				<dl>Law. The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.</dl>
				<dl>Loyalty. Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.</dl>
				<dl>Courage. You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don’t act, then who will?</dl>
				<dl>Responsibility. You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.</dl></ul>
		<p>Oath Spells<br>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>
	    <table class="cls" style="width:33%; float: right;">
		  <tr><th colspan="2">Oath of the Crown Spells</th></tr>

		<p>Channel Divinity<br>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<ul>
				<dl>Champion Challenge. As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from you.</dl>
				<dl>Turn the Tide. As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.</dl></ul>
		<p>Divine Allegiance<br>Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>
		<p>Unyielding Spirit<br>Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned.</p>
		<p>Exalted Champion<br>At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour:</p>
			<ul>
				<dl>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</dl>
				<dl>Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.</dl>
				<dl>You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.</dl></ul>
		<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

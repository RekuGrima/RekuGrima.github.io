			<div class="panel-heading">Dark Gifts</div>
			<div class="panel-body">The Dark Powers influence many who struggle within their clutches, tempting both the innocent and ambitious with whispered promises. These sinister bargains are rarely spoken, coming in dreams or mysterious visions, but their terms are always clear and their prices terrible. A character can select a Dark Gift from the "Dark Gifts Descriptions" section. This supernatural gift expresses both a mysterious power and insidious influence. Work with your DM to determine how your character gained this Dark Gift. Is it the manifestation of a family curse? Is it a reward for a sacrifice you made at a forgotten shrine? Did you bargain with a voice whispering from a mirror, the sea, or the Mists? Does the Dark Gift compound with your other character choices to reinforce your unique origin? Each Dark Gift can be expressed in various ways, with the following options exploring various manifestations to spark your imagination.
			<br>Dark Gifts are intended for starting characters, but characters who don't choose one might be presented with opportunities to gain a Dark Gift as their stories-and desperate circumstances-unfold.</div></div>
		  <div class="panel panel-primary" style="float:center;">
			<div class="panel-heading">Dark Bargains</div>
			<div class="panel-body">Characters who don't have a Dark Gift might gain one in the course of their adventures. At the DM's discretion, sinister forces might contact a character and offer them a Dark Gift in return for some service or future favor. If a character already has a Dark Gift, accepting such a bargain causes them to lose their current Dark Gift and gain a new one. A Dark Gift gained as a result of such a bargain reflects the agenda of the being or beings offering the bargain, be it the Dark Powers, a Darklord, or a more mysterious force. The particulars of the Dark Gift and how it will affect a character must be clear to a player before they choose whether or not to accept.<br>The offer of a Dark Gift might manifest in a dream, in a moment of frozen time, or when the character is alone. Typically, only one character is aware of a bargain, its terms, and whether or not it was accepted.<br>The DM might have a mysterious force intervene and offer a Dark Gift whenever a desperate or thematic instance presents itself, such as in any of the following cases:
			<ul>
			  <li>A Darklord will negotiate with a party only if a character seals the deal by accepting their Dark Gift.</li>
			  <li>Time stops while a character is on the brink of death. A mysterious voice offers to save the character's life, but only if they accept its Dark Gift.</li>
			  <li>An experiment or magical accident goes wrong. The DM allows a character to accept a Dark Gift or some other peril as a result.</li>
			  <li>A character breaks a vow or suffers a curse, gaining a Dark Gift as a result.</li>
			  <li>A character touches a mysterious amber sarcophagus, and a force within entreats them to accept its influence in the form of a Dark Gift</li></ul></div></div>

				<div class="panel-body"><p>Your soul isn't your own or, at least, it wasn't always yours. Whether you've lived past lives, your soul was swapped into a different body, or you have a link connecting you to another being, you experience echoes from another life. These echoes grant you knowledge, talents, or even languages you can't always explain, but they also intrude on your perceptions and beliefs unexpectedly. Roll on or choose an option from the Soul Echoes table to determine the nature of this Dark Gift. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>
				<table>
				  <tr><th>d6</th><th>Echo</th></tr>
				  <tr><td>1</td><td>My soul is linked with that of a person elsewhere, perhaps another domain, world, or plane.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>2</td><td>I have lived many times before, my soul reincarnating each time I die rather than passing on.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>3</td><td>My consciousness was removed from my original body and implanted in this one.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>4</td><td>I was physically and spiritually merged with another being.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>5</td><td>I share my body with an intangible, otherworldly force.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>6</td><td>Time fractures around me, and I sometimes collide with my own past or future.</td></tr></table>
				<p>Channeled Prowess. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.
				<p>Inherent Tongue. You can speak, read, and write one additional language of your choice.
				<p>Intrusive Echoes. Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your soul's memories emerge and overtake your perceptions and experiences. You might see people around you as someone other than who they are, or you become disoriented by a double-experience of the world around you. Roll on the Intrusive Echoes table to determine the effect of these vivid memories and perceptions. Once one of effects occur, these intrusive echoes can't manifest again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
				<table>
				  <tr><th>d6</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
				  <tr><td>1</td><td>You are charmed by a creature you can see (of the DM's choice) for 1 minute or until the creature damages you.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>2</td><td>You are frightened by a creature you can see (of the DM's choice) for 1 minute, or u ntil the creature damages you.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>3</td><td>You perceive another time or place around you until the end of your next turn. During this time, you are blinded to your actual surroundings.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>4</td><td>You perceive a different time or place overlapping your surrou ndings. Your speed is halved until the end ofyour next turn.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>5</td><td>Memories and sensations overwhelm you. You are incapacitated u ntil the start of your next turn.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>6</td><td>Your memory is one of triumph. You can reroll the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that you just made. You must use the new roll.</td></tr></table>

				<div class="panel-heading book" style="background-color: #003300; color:beige;">Gathered Whispers</div>
				<div class="panel-body"><p>You are haunted by spiritual beings, whether the souls of the departed or entities from another plane. Their voices endlessly whisper, taunt, or cajole, sometimes rising to unearthly howls. Only you can perceive the spirits, unless you allow them to speak through you. The spirits are intangible and invisible; anyone who can see invisible creatures sees only fleeting glimpses of these spirits as they haunt you. Roll on or choose an option from the Whispering Spirits table to determine what haunts you. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>
				<table>
				  <tr><th>d6</th><th>Spirits</th></tr>
				  <tr><td>1</td><td>A council of my dead ancestors watches over me.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>2</td><td>Fiendish presences vie for my soul.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>3</td><td>Unquiet souls are drawn to me and beg for peace.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>4</td><td>The spirits of those I killed linger around me.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>5</td><td>An alien intelligence intrudes upon my thoughts.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>6</td><td>A sibling I don't have shares my body.</td></tr></table>
				<p>Spirit Whispers. You learn the message cantrip if you don't already know it, and require no components to cast it. When you cast the spell, the messages are delivered by one of your whispering spirits rather than you or the target's voice. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift).</p>
				<p>Sudden Cacophony. When you are hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to channel your haunting spirits, letting their voices howl through you. If the attacker isn't deafened, add your proficiency bonus to your AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. Once this trait causes an attack to miss, you can't use the trait again until you finish a long rest.</p>
				<p>Voices from Beyond. Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, the haunting voices grow too loud to ignore. Roll on the Voices from Beyond table to determine the effect of these voices. Once one of these effects occurs, none of these haunting voices manifest again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
				<table>
				  <tr><th>d4</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
				  <tr><td>1</td><td>You have disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>2</td><td>You are deafened by the voices for 1 minute.</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>3</td><td>You are frightened of the creature closest to you, other than yourself, until the end of your next turn. If multiple creatures are closest, the DM chooses which creature you are frightened of</td></tr>
				  <tr><td>4</td><td>Within the next 10 minutes, you can ask your spirits about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. You can receive an omen as if you had cast the augury spell. The omen manifests as whisperings from your spirits perceptible only to you.</td></tr></table>

	<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">Most subrace traits are in addition to the trait listed in the base race section. Those that are named the same or are straight up better versions over write existing traits (example:Superior Darkvision replaces Darkvision. Those that don't follow those conventions will be denoted with an astrik and will replace an existing trait entirely.</p>

		<li>Creature Type. You are a Humanoid</li>
		<li>Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage</li>
		<li>Ancestral Legacy. If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</li>
		<li>Deathless Nature. You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:
		  <ul>
			<li>You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
			<li>You have advantage on death saving throws.</li>
			<li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
			<li>You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.</ul></li>
		<li>Knowledge from a Past Life. You temporarily remember glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 immediately after seeing the number on the d20 and add the number on the d6 to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li></ul>
